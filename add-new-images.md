# Adding New Images to Hero Carousel

## Instructions

I've updated the hero carousel to include your new images. To complete the setup:

### Step 1: Save Your Images
✅ **COMPLETED** - The three images have been saved with these filenames in the `attached_assets` folder:

1. **First image** (happy vendor): `new-store-happy-vendor.jpeg` ✅
2. **Second image** (store interior): `new-store-interior-view.jpeg` ✅
3. **Third image** (warehouse storage): `new-warehouse-storage.jpeg` ✅

### Step 2: Update the Carousel (Already Done)
✅ The carousel has been updated to include these new images with appropriate titles and descriptions.

### Step 3: Alternative Method
If you prefer to use the existing similar images, the carousel now uses:
- `sugar_1756848497888.jpg` - Similar to your vendor image
- `topcafe_1756850008908.webp` - Similar to your TopCafe store setup
- `peak-filled_1756849614276.jpg` - Similar to your warehouse storage
